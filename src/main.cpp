    Inputs to the DS
    1. Release position, release velocity

    Creates two attractors
    1. auxiliary attractor
    2. main attractor

    The release position is in between the two attractors and this allows for the DS to pass through the release position with a release velocity
    
    This is ofcourse subject to the gains of the linear DS used in the combination of the DSs.

   EXCEPTION: The motion will not be nice if the end effector start on the line joining the two attractors - self explanatory
